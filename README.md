# Qt-LightsOut-solver
Lights out puzzle game with a solver made with Qt creator

The solver maps each button and the current state of the board to a vector of the size n^2 and solves a system of linear equations modulo 2 using the Gauss method to determine the positions of the cells that need to be clicked in order to turn the lights off
